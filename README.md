# Control program for a robot
The robot is located in a two-dimensional room and moves around in the room by parsing a string of commands in English:

L - Turn left  R - Turn right  F - Move forward
Example string: LFFRFRFRFF

When the robot runs out of commands, it reports what square (x,y) it’s located at, and what direction it’s facing.
When the program starts, we must specify the size of the room and where the robot is located and which direction it is facing.

### Program is developed in Android studio for android application.
